# Mono.Options

**Mono.Options** is a small, but powerful, command line parsing library.  It has 
also struck a good balance for Unix and Windows developers as options can 
be used on both systems, and map well to practices on both systems.

This library can be downloaded from NuGet ([Mono.Options](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mono.Options)):

```
PM> Install-Package Mono.Options
```

This package supports almost all .NET platforms:

 - Full .NET Framework 4.0+ (Client Profile)
 - .NET Core 1.0
 - .NET Standard 1.6+
 - Portable Class Libraries (Profile 259)

## Getting Started

Lots more information is available in the [Getting Started Guide](GettingStarted.md), 
but some of the quick start information can be found here or in 
the [Details Guide](Details.md).

There are a few steps to get everything in place. First, we need to set up the 
options expected:

```c#
// these variables will be set when the command line is parsed
var verbosity = 0;
var shouldShowHelp = false;
var names = new List<string> ();
var repeat = 1;
// these are the available options, note that they set the variables
var options = new OptionSet { 
    { "n|name=", "the name of someone to greet.", n => names.Add (n) }, 
    { "r|repeat=", "the number of times to repeat the greeting.", (int r) => repeat = r }, 
    { "v", "increase debug message verbosity", v => { if (v != null) ++verbosity; } }, 
    { "h|help", "show this message and exit", h => shouldShowHelp = h != null },
};
```

Then, in the `static void Main (string[] args)` method, we can parse the incoming 
arguments and get a list of any extras:

```c#
List<string> extra;
try {
    // parse the command line
    extra = options.Parse (args);
} catch (OptionException e) {
    // output some error message
    Console.Write ("greet: ");
    Console.WriteLine (e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine ("Try `greet --help' for more information.");
    return;
}
```

This will read in the argements from the command line and set the variables. For
example, if the command line is:

    > greet.exe -n Matthew Welcome to Xamarin {0}!

Then, the variables will be processed and result in:

    verbosity      == 0
    shouldShowHelp == false
    names          == ["Matthew"]
    repeat         == 1
    extras         == ["Welcome to Xamarin {0}!"]
