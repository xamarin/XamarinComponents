Open Source Components for Xamarin are a collection of open source components (including bindings and plugins) created by Xamarin and others in the community.

## Status

Some of the bindings are obsoleted and commented out in the `manifest.yaml`. The reasons vary from binaries being removed 
from JCenter/BinTray/JFrog, to stale code or script API used in cake scripts.

Obsoleted bindings (might need some love for update):

*  Shopify
*  OpenId
*  AndroidThings
*  AnimatedCircleLoadingView

## Building

### Prerequisites

Before building the libraries and samples in this repository, you will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and the [Cake .NET Core Tool](http://cakebuild.net):

```sh
dotnet tool install -g cake.tool
```

When building on macOS, you may also need to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install cocoapods

# Ruby Gems
gem install cocoapods
```

### Compiling

You can either build all the libraries and samples in the repository from the root:

```sh
dotnet cake --name=<name-from-manifest>
```

Or, you can build each component separately:

```sh
cd <path-to-component>
dotnet cake
```

The name of each component can be [found in the manifest.yaml](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/blob/master/manifest.yaml). For example, to build the `ARCore` component, you can either start the build from the root:

```sh
dotnet cake --name=ARCore --target=nuget
```

Or, you can navigate to the folder and run it from there:

```sh
cd Android/ARCore
dotnet cake --target=nuget
```

The following targets can be specified using the `--target=<target-name>`:

 - `libs` builds the class library bindings (depends on `externals`)
 - `externals` downloads and builds the external dependencies
 - `samples` builds all of the samples (depends on `libs`)
 - `nuget` builds the nuget packages (depends on `libs`)
 - `clean` cleans up everything


### Working in Visual Studio

Before the `.sln` files will compile in the IDEs, the external dependencies need to be downloaded. This can be done by running the `externals` target:

```sh
dotnet cake --target=externals
```

After the externals are downloaded and built, the `.sln` files should compile in your IDE.
