# OpenCensus 

Checker bindings for Xamarin.Android which are Grpc dependencies (Grpc.Core).

The Checker Framework enhances Java's type system to make it more powerful and useful. This 
lets software developers detect and prevent errors in their Java programs. The Checker Framework 
includes compiler plug-ins ("checkers") that find bugs or verify their absence. It also permits 
users to write compiler plug-ins.
